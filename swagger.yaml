        In the repsonse, the timeSent is a unix timestamp that was recorded when the message was sent. You can find more information that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time. When testing this, it's hard to get it accurate because network delays mean there is some variability in when the server will "lodge" the request. To solve this, when testing simply check if the received message falls within a 1 second range of what you'd expect.
